# Budget-Tracker üèñ

Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Budget Tracker gives users the ability to track their spending and budget on vacation. For this project, I added offline functionality to an existing budgeting application. Users can add expenses and deposits to their budget with, or without an internet connection. Users are able to interact with the application if they are offline- their information is stored in the indexDB, and retrieved as soon as they are back online to bring their "online" budget to date. So if users travel to an area with "spotty" service, they will be able to continue to track their funds. Users can clear their old budgets after each trip with the "delete budget" button.
